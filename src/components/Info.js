<p className="f4 f4-m fw3 lh-copy db">James is superlative. He is the kind of product you obtain when you mix hard work, talent, humility, dedication and continuous self-improvement. I'm sure James will shine and do well in anything he tries to do, but when it comes to design he has attributes difficult to find all together: Apart from his design background, James experience goes beyond design having experience with web and mobile development, which gives him and holistic understanding on the matter.</p>

<p className="f4 f4-m fw3  lh-copy db ">James is the kind of designer that is not afraid to get his hands dirty and code up his designs in html, css and even javascript, making the job of the developer(s) much easier and workflow seamless and efficient. He is not afraid of learning new technologies (like tachyons or react) quickly and he is always using the best tools on the market and constantly researching new ones. His approach is simple, yet elegant. After working with him and a few others like him, I would not work with a designer that just provides PSD files and alike. Asset to any team.</p>
